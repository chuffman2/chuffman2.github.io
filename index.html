  <p class="CHp"> Hi, my name is Cortni Huffman, I am a junior and am majoring in communications and public relations, with a minor in urban and regional planning as well as working towards my leadership certificate. I am from Marysville, Washington and at home have 2 kitties who I love with all my heart. I live on campus right now, but next year my friends and I are getting an apartment so all I can think about is decorations and furniture, to make our apartment look 'cute'. </p>

<p class="CHp">After being here at Eastern, I have really wanted to become a college professor and obtain my M.A/PhD at University of Washington because they have a wonderful program, and it’s closer to home. Although that’s my dream job right now, it might change in the near future, because last quarter I wanted to do some sort of celebrity PR. </p> 

<p class="CHp"> I hate being bored, so when I do have spare time I love to be outdoors, and on this side of Washington it’s so much easier to do!  I love playing tennis, going on hikes, and kind of exploring Spokane because there’s so much to see. I enjoy cooking and love trying new foods. I also am really into Netflix, like everyone else and am currently watching Lie to Me. </p>
   
   <h2> Traveling </h2>
   
   <p class="traveling"> Ever since I was small, traveling has been a passion of mine. I've gotten to see some amazing things and immerse myself in different cultures. On June 27th I will be traveling to Europe and visiting Paris, Rome and Barcelona which I am so excited about! </p>
   
   <h3> Costa Rica </h3>

   <p class="CostaRica"> When I was in the 8th grade I had the amazing oppurtunity to go to Costa Rica with my grandmother for a week. We went jet-skiing, on a beautiful hike involving hanging bridges and my favorite snorkeling. Costa Rica is a beautiful place filled with trees and wildlife for as far as the eye can see. We saw crocidiles, monkeys, and many different species of birds. </p>

   
   <h3> Bahamas </h3>
    <img src= "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/1183170/Bahamas.JPG" alt="Bahamas" class="bahamas-pic">  
   
   <p class="Bahamas"> When I was 16 my mom, boyfriend and I went on a cruise to the Bahamas. It was an amazing experience. We went and did the Atlantis tour which was breath taking. When I was younger I always saw the commericals and I never thought I would ever visit, so when we got to go on the tour my dreams came true. The Bahamas was so fun to be in with the locals and the fun music. Fun fact about the Bahamas is that unless you are a tourist.  the it is illegal to gamble! </p>
   
   <h3> Mud Runs! </h3>
   <p class="mudruns"> My family and I are also super into mud runs! I have been doing them over the years and they are always a blast. Every year we recruit more and more people to join us and I even got my grandpa to come this year! </p>
